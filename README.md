## üìå Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a complete product analytics system for an early-stage startup that has developed an innovative application merging a messenger with a personalized news feed. In this ecosystem, users can browse and interact with posts (views, likes) while simultaneously communicating with each other through direct messages. The core challenge was to build the entire analytical infrastructure from scratch to understand user behavior across both features and enable data-driven decision-making.

This initiative aimed to:

- **Establish Analytical Infrastructure**
  - Design and implement a scalable data architecture for real-time analytics
  - Create a single source of truth for product metrics and user behavior data

- **Enable Product Intelligence**
  - Build comprehensive dashboards for monitoring key product metrics
  - Analyze user retention patterns and engagement drivers
  - Investigate sudden metric fluctuations and user drop-off points

- **Drive Data-Driven Experimentation**
  - Implement rigorous A/B testing framework for feature validation
  - Ensure statistical reliability of experiment results through proper design

- **Develop Predictive Capabilities**
  - Create forecasting models for key business metrics
  - Enable proactive planning and early anomaly detection

- **Automate Business Intelligence**
  - Implement automated reporting systems for stakeholder updates
  - Build proactive alerting for metric anomalies and system issues

- **Generate Actionable Insights**
  - Translate data findings into concrete product recommendations
  - Establish continuous monitoring processes for business health
